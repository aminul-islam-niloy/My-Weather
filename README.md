# My Weather API

My Weather API is a simple ASP.NET Core web API that provides weather information using the OpenWeatherMap API.

## Getting Started

To get started with My Weather API, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   git clone https://github.com/aminul-islam-niloy/My-Weather.git
   ```

2. Open the solution in Visual Studio.

3. Build the solution.

4. Run the application.

5. Use the Swagger UI or send HTTP requests to `https://localhost:7069/Weather/{city}` to get weather information for a specific city.

## Configuration

{
  "OpenWeatherMap": {

  }
}

Replace `YOUR_API_KEY` with your actual OpenWeatherMap API key.
